We are thinking of coming up with some sort of pubmed search query where we select based on criteria possibly including topic, study design (hard?, use keywords?), journal, etc.

We will attempt to reduce bias by picking a search strategy while restricting ourselves to articles published before 1 Jan, then picking our actual articles with the same strategy but no restriction (and using the XX most recent ones).
